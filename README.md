This app has the basic functionality of any chatroom app, however this one is built with Vue.js and PhoneGap in order to run on mobile devices.

When designing and coding this app, I was sure to take a 'mobile first' approach. 

For templating I made use of Framework7. It's a lot like bootstrap, but for Mobile devices.
